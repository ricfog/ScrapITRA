# ScrapITRA

The data contains information on runners' performance for all runners that took part in ITRA races between 2010 and 2018.

```Race_info``` contains data on the races. ```Runners_performance``` contains information on the results of each of the participants. The two files can be joined using the "key" variable.

If you use the data set for fun or research, please reach out to me and let me know how you are using it.
